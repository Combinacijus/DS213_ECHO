# DS213_ECHO

This is a customized DS213 APP firmware with Roll Mode support. Based on the official app
firmware v1.27, and fixed some bugs.

## What is [Roll Mode](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/roll-mode/)?

On an oscilloscope, roll mode is a method of displaying acquired waveform data without
waiting for the complete waveform record. For example, if a sweep was 10 divisions long
with a rate of one second per division, and roll mode wasnâ€™t available, it would take 10
seconds to fill the waveform record. But using roll mode, the oscilloscope will immediately
begin displaying results rather than waiting the full 10 seconds.

## Toolchain

The firmware is built on GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain. Both Windows and Linux are tested.

###  on Windows:

```
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe (GNU Tools for Arm Embedded Processors 9-2019-q4-major) 9.

## FLASH Layout

The MCU of DS213 is STM32F103VET6, with 512kB(0x80000) FLASH. The FLASH layout is as follows:

| Name | Start      | Length  |
|:----:|:----------:|:--------|
| DFU  | 0x08000000 | 0x08000 |
| APP  | 0x08008000 | 0x68000 |
| FPGA | 0x08070000 | 0x0D800 |
| LOGO | 0x0807D800 | 8310    |

## Firmware Update Procedure

1. Enter DS213 DFU mode.
2. Copy FPGA_CFG.ADR to DFU disk, Then the DFU disk will restart.
3. Copy STMU_213_018.bin to DFU disk, Then the DFU disk will restart.
4. Copy DS213_ECHO_v20.12.25.hex to DFU disk.
5. Restart DS213.

There are no address information in the .bin file, so we put a .ADR file to DFU disk to setup the firmware start address.
That's what step 2 did. However, the .hex file contains address information, we don't need a .ADR file.
If your DS213 is using the official latest firmware, the FPGA is latest 018 version, you can omit step 2 and 3.
