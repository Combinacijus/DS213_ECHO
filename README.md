# DS213_ECHO

This is a customized DS213 APP firmware with Roll Mode support. Based on the official app
firmware v1.27, and fixed some bugs.

## What is [Roll Mode](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/roll-mode/)?

On an oscilloscope, roll mode is a method of displaying acquired waveform data without
waiting for the complete waveform record. For example, if a sweep was 10 divisions long
with a rate of one second per division, and roll mode wasnâ€™t available, it would take 10
seconds to fill the waveform record. But using roll mode, the oscilloscope will immediately
begin displaying results rather than waiting the full 10 seconds.
